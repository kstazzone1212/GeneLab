> **Explore genes. Trace the evidence. Analyze molecular sequences.**

GeneLab is a bilingual scientific exploration platform for human molecular genetics. It connects live public scientific records with gene, variant, literature, and sequence-analysis tools while keeping provenance and limitations visible.

**Live project:** [https://krissj1212.github.io/GeneLab/](https://krissj1212.github.io/GeneLab/)

> GeneLab is an educational and research-support platform. It is not a diagnostic system, clinical interpretation service, substitute for genetic counseling, laboratory validation, or peer-reviewed scientific judgment.

## Why GeneLab?

Scientific information is distributed across specialized databases, each with different identifiers, scopes, and evidence standards. This creates friction for students, educators, and early-stage researchers who need to move from a gene to its variants, proteins, literature, and computational analysis without losing the source context.

GeneLab provides a single, accessible workflow:

```text
Search -> Explore -> Analyze -> Read the evidence -> Interpret carefully
```

The platform is designed around a simple principle: **retrieved scientific data, user input, computational results, and future AI explanations must remain visibly distinct.**

## Current Capabilities

### Human Gene Explorer

- Searches arbitrary human genes through live NCBI Gene records.
- Supports symbols, names, aliases, NCBI Gene IDs, and Ensembl Gene IDs.
- Displays official identity, organism, aliases, genomic location, assembly, gene type, descriptions, designations, record dates, cross-references, transcripts, protein products, and source metadata when supplied by the database.
- Uses Ensembl REST for additional gene enrichment.
- Preserves exact gene identity and never substitutes an unrelated result.

### Variant Explorer

- Has its own search interface for a human gene or a direct ClinVar accession.
- Retrieves variant records from ClinVar through public NCBI E-utilities.
- Displays HGVS changes, genomic location, molecular consequence, clinical significance, review status, conditions, and provenance.
- Supports filtering by variant type and molecular consequence.
- Keeps variant information separate from the gene detail page.

### Scientific Literature

- Searches PubMed on demand.
- Displays sourced publication titles, authors, journals, years, identifiers, and official PubMed links.
- Does not generate article interpretations or fabricated summaries.

### Virtual Molecular Lab

Local computational tools for educational exploration:

- Sequence length
- DNA/RNA/protein alphabet detection
- FASTA input support
- GC percentage
- DNA transcription to RNA
- Reverse complement
- Basic codon translation
- ORF detection on both strands
- Restriction-site detection
- Primer candidates with GC, melting temperature, and warnings
- Sequence comparison with identity percentage and positional differences
- Reproducibility notebook records with notes and JSON export
- Up to 20 custom field/value data points per notebook entry

The calculations are pure TypeScript functions, separated from the UI and covered by unit tests.

### Evidence Research Assistant

The current assistant organizes retrieved gene fields and their sources. It is intentionally evidence-based and does not present generative AI output as authoritative scientific information.

### Bilingual and Accessible Interface

- English and Spanish UI.
- Hash-based deep links compatible with GitHub Pages.
- Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Keyboard navigation and visible focus states.
- Semantic landmarks and screen-reader labels.
- Light and dark themes.
- Reduced-motion support.
- Local workspace notes and experiment history.
- Optional email/password account synchronization without Google or Apple OAuth.

## Scientific Sources

Live integrations currently include:

| Source | Current role |
| --- | --- |
| [NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/) | Human gene search, normalized records, full gene XML detail |
| [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) | Gene enrichment and Ensembl Gene ID lookup |
| [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) | On-demand variant records and clinical database assertions |
| [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | Literature search and publication metadata |

Additional sources are catalogued for future integration, including HGNC, UniProt, dbSNP, and Europe PMC.

Every live record can retain:

- Database name
- Scientific identifier
- Official URL
- Retrieval timestamp
- Evidence category
- Known limitations

Database assertions may be incomplete, change over time, or differ between submissions. GeneLab does not collapse those differences into an invented universal confidence score.

## Technology

- Vite
- TypeScript
- Vanilla browser APIs
- Vitest
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages

The project includes an optional Node.js API for accounts and notebook synchronization. Public scientific APIs are still accessed through provider-specific service adapters, not directly from UI components.

## Architecture

```text
src/
  components/             Reusable explorer, evidence, and site-page views
  data/                   Source catalog and clearly labelled demo fixtures
  i18n/                   English and Spanish dictionaries
  models/                 Typed scientific entities and provenance models
  services/
    adapters/             NCBI, Ensembl, ClinVar, and PubMed adapters
    live.ts               Live gene service composition
    liveVariants.ts       Live variant service
    liveLiterature.ts     Live literature service
  utils/                  Pure sequence and data-transformation functions
  server.mjs              Optional account and experiment synchronization API
  styles/                 Theme, responsive, and accessibility styles
  main.ts                 Hash routing and application shell
docs/
  architecture.md         Integration boundaries and scientific design rules
.github/workflows/
  deploy-pages.yml        Test, build, and deploy pipeline
```

The UI never calls provider URLs directly. Adapters normalize external responses into shared models such as `Gene`, `Variant`, `Publication`, `Sequence`, `AnalysisResult`, and `ScientificSource`.

## Demo Data Policy

Synthetic demo data is retained only for interface testing and is activated explicitly with `demo=1` in the URL. It is labelled:

```text
DEMO DATA - NOT LIVE SCIENTIFIC DATABASE DATA
```

Demo data never limits live gene searches and is never silently used as a replacement for a failed scientific request.

## Run Locally

Requirements: Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krissj1212/GeneLab.git
cd GeneLab
npm install
npm run dev
```

To enable synchronization between devices, run the API in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run api
```

The local API listens on `http://localhost:8787` and stores data in `.data/genelab.json`. For a deployed frontend, set `VITE_API_URL` to the public API URL when building:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com/api npm run build
```

The local account mode remains available when the API is offline. Production deployments should add HTTPS, a persistent database, secure cookies or rotating tokens, email verification, password recovery, rate limiting, backups, and secret management.

Open the local URL shown by Vite. To run the production build locally:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Deployment is automated by [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml).

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Open **Settings -> Pages**.
3. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Push to `main` or run the workflow manually from the **Actions** tab.
5. GitHub Actions runs tests, builds `dist/`, and deploys the result.

To enable cloud synchronization in the Pages build, create a repository variable named `VITE_API_URL` under **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Variables**. Its value must be the public URL of the deployed GeneLab API, including `/api`. GitHub Pages hosts the frontend only; `server.mjs` must run separately on a Node-capable service.

The expected public URL is:

```text
https://krissj1212.github.io/GeneLab/
```

The Vite base is relative and hash routing is used because GitHub Pages does not provide SPA rewrite rules by default.

## Testing

The project currently has 30 passing tests covering:

- Gene search normalization and filtering
- NCBI response normalization and provenance
- Exact gene identity and cache isolation
- Ensembl ID lookup
- ClinVar variant normalization and empty results
- PubMed response mapping
- DNA/RNA/protein sequence analysis
- FASTA headers and multiline sequences
- Ambiguous nucleotide handling

```bash
npm test
```

## Scientific and Technical Limitations

- API availability and rate limits are controlled by external providers.
- The browser does not contain private credentials or API keys.
- A secured serverless proxy may be needed for higher-volume production usage.
- ClinVar interpretations are database records, not independent clinical conclusions.
- PubMed currently provides publication metadata rather than full article text or AI summaries.
- The sequence lab provides educational calculations, not validated laboratory protocols or production bioinformatics pipelines.
- Coverage depends on the records returned by connected public databases at request time; GeneLab does not claim to contain every human gene locally.

## Roadmap

The core contest scope is implemented. Future improvements may include:

- Additional HGNC, UniProt, dbSNP, and Europe PMC adapters.
- Pagination and stronger provider-specific throttling.
- Browser-level accessibility and mobile testing.
- More sequence-analysis operations and reproducibility exports.
- A separately secured, evidence-grounded AI service if a backend is introduced.

## License

A project license should be selected before public release. Until then, treat the repository as source-available for evaluation and do not assume reuse permissions.

## Team / Project Context

GeneLab was built as a solo-developer scientific hackathon project with a focus on:

- Reproducibility over visual claims
- Source attribution over opaque aggregation
- Public static deployment over unnecessary infrastructure
- Educational exploration over clinical interpretation
- A maintainable foundation that can grow without fabricating scientific data
